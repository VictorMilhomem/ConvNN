# Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implemented using TensorFlow. 
The first CNN implemented in this repository is LeNet,
which was originally developed for digit recognition but has since become a standard architecture for image classification tasks.

# Contents
The repository contains the following files:

LeNet.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of LeNet using TensorFlow and Google Colab.
README.md: This README file.

# Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code in this repository:

  * Python 3.x
  * TensorFlow 2.x
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib

# Conclusion
This repository provides a simple implementation of the LeNet architecture using TensorFlow and Google Colab. It can be used as a starting point for more complex CNNs and other image classification tasks. 
The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone learning about deep learning and computer vision.
